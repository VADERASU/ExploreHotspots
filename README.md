# Exploring Geographic Hotspots Using Topological Data Analysis
The project introduces a scalar field topology (SFT)-based visual analytics framework for the interactive characterization and analysis of hotspots within kernel density estimate
derived from point events. The visual analytics system supports the analyst and demonstrates the merit of the proposed framework on two crime datasets, Chicago gang crime data and Purdue general crime data. 

## Data
The Chicago ganga crime data and Purdue general crime data are the vtk format, which can be loaded by paraview. 
Please download them at 


Nodejs is used to connet the js front end and paraview(connecting to ttk) backend.
The system is to explore the crime data using new types of hotspot, mergeTree based.
